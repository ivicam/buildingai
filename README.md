# Create personalized recommendations for Customers in fast food restaurant

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Goal of this project would be to create system which would display recommendations tailored to each Customer preferences based on the historical data for each Customer. Data will be gathered using information about order history crossreferenced with other information which could be used to connect it to the specific Customer (e.g. loyalty card, credit card information, vehicle licenceplate on drive-in etc.). Recommendations will be displayed to Customer on self-service kiosks and at menu display board in drive-in.


## Background

In recent years fast-food sales have slowed as people turn to more healtier alternatives. By using recommendation system, similiar like one implemented for example on Amazon or Netflix, total sale should be increased.

## How is it used?



Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Self-service kiosk (example)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Denton_House_LI_03_-_Order_kiosk.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Denton_House_LI_03_-_Order_kiosk.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
